# Isle of Ruby CFP 2018


## Proposal

### Abstract

Depression is a common illness.

As developers we are privileged to work in an industry that is by and large open and willing to talk about mental health. When we look beyond our industry, it feels tempting to try to engineer some solution to 'fix' the greater issue of silence about mental health, but I think that one of the best things we can do to help with this is simply share the same openness we benefit from with the rest of the world.

Many of us have our own insights into coping with depression. For me, writing code is one of the few things that gets me through bad times and back to a mental state where I want the company of my friends and peers. I use code to hook into and subvert some basic behaviors that can otherwise be destructive, and use them to get me through it.

My hope is that hearing my experiences and coping strategies will help make depression a little less taboo, help people find some insights of their own, and maybe provide a model for talking about depression with people outside our community.


## Details

This talk would probably benefit from being ~20 minutes + questions, but can fit into 15.

The talk includes a little bit of detail on what depression looks and feels like for me. This is SFW, but the title should be content warning in and of itself I think. I do not talk about suicide or death.

Whenever my symptoms come up, I keep the talk observational and avoid trying to diagnose or analyze things (since I'm not a doctor!). I dig into how I hook into what otherwise might be self-destructive behaviors or impulses, and make them productive and helpful through code.

#### Outline

##### Introduction

- introduce myself
  - who I am, what I do
  - then, note upfront that I suffer from depression

##### Why this talk? Why this talk here?

- the tech community is in my experience more open and willing to talk about mental health
- this has been a saving grace for me
- how do we share this outside the tech community?
- we could build an app... but that runs dangerously close to losing the thing that helps me the most--other people who care
- as non-tech an approach as it may be, the thing we have that's worth sharing is our willingness to talk about mental health
- we should model our behavior out
  - by talking about it at conferences like this
  - and by talking to our friends, family, acquaintances outside of the tech industry
- another human sharing their experiences goes a long way. We should encourage that behavior *everywhere*
- in that spirit, here's how I cope, and how I pull myself through my bad, hard, isolationist periods until I can talk to others again
- it's definitely the approach of a programmer, but that's who I am. My hope is that others will see a rhyme in what I do with something that might help them

##### Sharing my own experience and coping strategies

- a very quick overview of how I cope in general
  - behaviors I maintain to keep myself sane
  - indicators that let me know when a depressive spell is coming
- a quick overview of what depression looks like for me, and the relevant symptoms for this talk
  - serious self-doubt, questioning my own value or the value of my contributions to the world
  - desire to shut myself away from the world and other people
  - an impulse to make my life even more difficult in order to punish myself for something
  - apathy and sometimes even a desire to prove I'm right about being worthless by not doing anything useful or productive
- now, how I get myself from depression to starting to be OK: I redirect my depressive and self-destructive impulses into helping myself by writing code
  - I let myself give in to the desire to be isolated from the world--I put on headphones and disappear into the code and block the world out. With the rest of the world out of mind, I no longer feel as much pressure to 'feel better' for those around me
  - when I stop badgering myself to feel better, I free up a lot of my mental faculties again, and I can devote my full attention to the code. Meanwhile, I'm not being confront with the social world as much and so I'm not berating myself as much for failing at an imagined *everything*
  - then I get into the flow: write tests, and code, and search stack overflow, and test, and code... which creates a sense of momentum. More on this in a moment
  - after a while I'll have **made** something, and that sense of accomplishment can be enough to snap me out of depression
  - and if it's not, it still makes me want to share what I've done, and that means I'll start engaging with other humans without second-guessing my self-worth, which also helps bring me out
- but... coming back to the 'step' of writing code--this is more than just a step or a single slide in a deck--it's hours. It's days. This is the core of my whole approach here. I hook into my addiction to seeing the test suite turn green when practicing TDD to keep me moving
  - starting with red tests almost perversely engages my desire to make my life difficult, but in a productive and (for me) healthy way
  - solving the problems required to make those tests green also is difficult and satisfies the same desire
  - very importantly, that difficulty can't get overwhelming. Tests provide structure--they give me the luxury of myopathy again, to focus on only one thing at a time (unit tests are especially great when I'm like this)
  - seeing that test suite go green gives me that little hit of joy at the accomplishment, which helps build forward momentum, because it's a little bit addictive. And so I keep going
  - this loops back on itself over and over. Luckily for me more often than not this continues until either the momentum itself makes me feel productive and saner, or until I've got something I can show others that I'm actually a little bit proud of

##### Conclusion

- we are very lucky to work in an industry that pays as much attention to our mental health as it does
- for me, the first time I heard someone openly talk about their own experiences had a very big impact--we should share that with everyone
- mental health is hard--I'm not a doctor, and sometimes what I've talked about here isn't enough. I'm lucky enough that it is for me. But I'm always careful to say that this is what works for me, and I don't want to push this on anyone else as a simple solution


#### Notes

It's worth pointing out that I don't have an unhealthy relationship with writing code--it doesn't feel like a punishment in and of itself, but the difficulty of solving a hard problem *can* satisfy my desire to make my own life even more difficult. I also try to make this clear in the talk.

I don't generalize in this talk: this is entirely my own experience of depression, and I highlight that throughout. When I gave this talk in my team, a few other people came up to me after and we've spoken some about their experiences (not included in the talk either). It hasn't fixed us, but it has meant that we feel less isolated and more comfortable talking about it when things flare.

## Pitch

Mental health is a bigger problem than I think most people realize, and openness about it can be a big help.

A lot of the time depression can go unnoticed or unspoken, and this can lead to sufferers feeling isolated or like pariahs--'if everyone else is fine and can get on with things, why am I so broken that I always feel like this?'

The purpose of this talk is to highlight how lucky we are to work in an industry that supports our mental health, and to encourage others in our industry to share the openness we enjoy with people outside. I share my own experience with depression as an example, and in a way to start the ball rolling. If anyone tries out some of my coping strategies and finds them useful, that's an added bonus.

I am not a mental health professional, but I do suffer from depression, and I share my own experiences to hopefully help others, if only by raising awareness.



## Bio

I am from Bath, but originally from the LA area. You can find me at [flyinggrizzly.io](https://www.flyinggrizzly.io) and [Github](https://github.com/flyinggrizzly).

I am a Ruby/Rails developer at the University of Bath, where I work on our bespoke content management systems. I'm still new as a programmer, and I've got lots to learn still... but code does more for me than just provide an income. It's opened up communities and friends, and has been a lifeline for my mental health: writing code is one of the few things I can do to help myself when I'm struggling with depression.

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably reading SF/F, playing roleplaying or boardgames, or doing any of the number of small things we have to do each day as humans.
