# Co(d|p)ing with depression outline

This talk would probably benefit from being ~20 minutes + questions, but can fit into 15.

The talk will start with a little bit of detail on what depression looks and feels like for me. (SFW, but the title should be content warning in and of itself I think. I do not talk about suicide or death in this talk.) I keep this part observational and avoid trying to diagnose or analyze things (not a doctor!). Then I really dig into how I hook into what otherwise might be self-destructive behaviors or impulses, and make them productive and helpful through code.

## Outline

- introduce myself
  - who I am, what I do
  - then, note upfront that I suffer from depression

- first, a very quick overview of how I cope in general
  - behaviors I maintain to keep myself sane
  - indicators that let me know when a depressive spell is coming

- second, a quick overview of what depression looks like for me, and the relevant symptoms for this talk
  - serious self-doubt
  - desire to shut myself away from the world and other people
  - questioning my own value or the value of my contributions to the world
  - an impulse to make my life even more difficult in order to punish myself for something
  - apathy and sometimes even a desire to prove I'm right about being worthless by not doing anything useful or productive

- now, how I get myself from depression to starting to be OK: I redirect my depressive and self-destructive impulses into helping myself by writing code
  - I let myself give in to the desire to be isolated from the world--I put on headphones and disappear into the code and block the world out. With the rest of the world out of mind, I no longer feel as much pressure to 'feel better' for those around me
  - when I stop badgering myself to feel better, I free up a lot of my mental faculties again, and I can devote my full attention to the code. Meanwhile, I'm not being confront with the social world as much and so I'm not berating myself as much for failing at an imagined *everything*
  - then I get into the flow: write tests, and code, and search stack overflow, and test, and code... which creates a sense of momentum. More on this in a moment
  - after a while I'll have **made** something, and that sense of accomplishment can be enough to snap me out of depression
  - and if it's not, it still makes me want to share what I've done, and that means I'll start engaging with other humans without second-guessing my self-worth, which also helps bring me out

- but... coming back to the 'step' of writing code--this is more than just a step or a single slide in a deck--it's hours. It's days. This is the core of my whole approach here. I hook into my addiction to seeing the test suite turn green when practicing TDD to keep me moving
  - starting with red tests almost perversely engages my desire to make my life difficult, but in a productive and (for me) healthy way
  - solving the problems required to make those tests green also is difficult and satisfies the same desire
  - very importantly, that difficulty can't get overwhelming. Tests provide structure--they give me the luxury of myopathy again, to focus on only one thing at a time (unit tests are especially great when I'm like this)
  - seeing that test suite go green gives me that little hit of joy at the accomplishment, which helps build forward momentum, because it's a little bit addictive. And so I keep going
  - this loops back on itself over and over. Luckily for me more often than not this continues until either the momentum itself makes me feel productive and saner, or until I've got something I can show others that I'm actually a little bit proud of

I think it's worth pointing out that I don't have an unhealthy relationship with writing code--it doesn't feel like a punishment in and of itself, but the difficulty of solving a hard problem *can* satisfy my desire to make my own life even more difficult. I also try to make this clear in the talk.

I am careful not to generalize in this talk. This is entirely my own experience of depression, and I highlight that throughout. When I gave this talk in my team, a few other people came up to me after and we've spoken some about their experiences (not included in the talk either). It hasn't fixed us, but it has meant that we feel less isolated and more comfortable talking about it when things flare.
