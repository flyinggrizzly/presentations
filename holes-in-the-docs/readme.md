# A short lightning talk about the commitments we make to users with our tooling

There's a funny thing, where as your tools approach greater consistency and
better functionality, any deviations from that consistency has a greater effect
and is more visible for its deviance.

I've run into this in the AWS docs when doing things that people probably
weren't expecting when they build the tools. Doesn't mean it's not a valid use
case, but seeing holes in the docs made me feel like a crazy person.

We should watch out for these holes, because they subtly undermine our users'
trust.
